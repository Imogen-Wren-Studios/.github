## Hi there 👋

My Name is Imogen Wren. Pronouns are She/Her.

This organisation is to collate and collect all of the audio development aimed at musicans, guitarists, bass players and performers. It is mostly going to be a source for
build documents, design documents and will act as a record for the open source projects I work on in my spare time. It may also include repos relating to DAWs and musically 
orientated software.

I previously designed, built and released stompboxes under the Pan Galactic brand, however I have decided to make Pan Galactic a source of educational content regarded technology and embedded systems, and move 
my more commercial projects to Imogen Wren Studios
