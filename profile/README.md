## Hi there 👋
## About Me

My Name is Imogen Wren. <br> Pronouns: She/Her. <br>
Since 2016 I have been blending my love of electronics with my love of music, 


## About Imogen Wren Studios

This organisation is to collate and collect all of the audio equipment development aimed at musicans, guitarists, bass players and performers. It is mostly going to be a source for build documents, design documents and will act as a record for the open source projects I work on in my spare time. It may also include repos relating to DAWs and music orientated software. It may also include some of my lighting projects, especially those that could be used in musical contexts.

I previously designed, built and released stompboxes under the Pan Galactic brand, however I have decided to make Pan Galactic a source of educational content regarded technology and embedded systems, and move my more artistic side projects to Imogen Wren Studios.
